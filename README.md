# Dice Poker

Want to enjoy a relaxed game of dice poker without doing the math in your head? Look no further
because the DicePoker app was designed to help you out.

DicePoker allows users to play a game with up to 6 players in total. The app also stores historical
game data directly on your phone to be able to display the latest high scores.
